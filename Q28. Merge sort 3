Given an array of integers, count the number of smaller elements that appear to the right of each element. Implement a solution using merge sort to efficiently count these elements. Output the result as an array of counts corresponding to each element in the original array.

Example
Input:
4
5 2 6 1

Output: 
2 1 1 0 

Explanation:
To the right of 5, there are 2 smaller elements (2 and 1).
To the right of 2, there is only 1 smaller element (1).
To the right of 6, there is 1 smaller element (1).
To the right of 1, there is 0 smaller element.

Input format :
The first line of input contains a single integer n, representing the length of the array.
The second line contains n space-separated integers, representing the elements of the array.

Output format :
The output prints a single line containing the counts of smaller elements for each value in the array, separated by a space.

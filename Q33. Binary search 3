Sharon is working on a sorted array of integers and wants to determine the count of elements that are less than or equal to a specific key. 



As her supportive programmer, you are tasked with creating a program to assist Sharon in counting the number of elements that meet this criterion (less than or equal to the given key) using the binary search technique.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of an integer N, representing the size of the array.

The second line consists of N space-separated integers, the elements of the array.

The third line consists of an integer key, the value to search for in the array.

Output format :
The output prints a single integer, representing the count of elements less than or equal to the given key.

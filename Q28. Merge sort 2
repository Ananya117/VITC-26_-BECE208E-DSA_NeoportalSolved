Vishnu, a math enthusiast, is given a task to explore the magic of numbers. He has an array of positive integers, and his goal is to find the integer with the highest digit sum in the sorted array using the merge sort algorithm.
You have to assist Vishnu in implementing the merge sort algorithm.

Example
Input:
6
789 123 456 876 234 567

Output:
The sorted array is: 123 234 456 567 789 876 
The integer with the highest digit sum is: 789

Explanation
Sorted Array Output: 123 234 456 567 789 876
The digit sum of an integer is the sum of its individual digits.
In this case, the integer 789 has the highest digit sum (7 + 8 + 9 = 24).

Input format :
The first line of input consists of an integer N, representing the number of elements in the array.
The second line consists of N space-separated integers, representing the array elements.

Output format :
The first line prints "The sorted array is: " followed by the sorted array in ascending order.
The second line prints "The integer with the highest digit sum is: " followed by the integer with the highest-digit sum.
